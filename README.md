# People Detection and Counting using YOLOv8

## 📌 Project Description
This project detects and counts the number of people present in an image using a pretrained YOLOv8 object detection model. The program reads an image, identifies people in the image, draws bounding boxes around them, and displays the total number of people detected.

The project is implemented using Python, OpenCV, and the Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework, and is designed to run in Google Colab without any hardware requirements.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To detect people in an image using a deep learning model  
- To draw bounding boxes around detected individuals  
- To count the total number of people present in the image  
- To understand the use of pretrained models for computer vision tasks

## 🧠 About YOLOv8
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a deep learning-based object detection algorithm that processes the entire image in a single forward pass. YOLOv8 is the latest version, offering improved accuracy and speed. In this project, YOLOv8 is used to detect the **person** class from images.

# People-Detection-and-Counting-using-YOLOv8
This project detects and counts the number of people present in an image using a pretrained YOLOv8 deep learning model. The system draws bounding boxes around detected people and displays the total count. The project is implemented using Python and OpenCV and runs completely in Google Colab without requiring any hardware.
